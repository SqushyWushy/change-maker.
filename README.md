# Change Maker API 🪙

## 🚀 About
The **Change Maker API** is a Flask-based application designed to calculate spare change from purchases, project savings growth with a 5% interest rate, and assign a fun, quirky "savings personality" to users. Inspired by the philosophy of turning small actions into meaningful outcomes, this API aligns with Acorns' micro-investing principles.

## 🛠 Features
- **Spare Change Calculator**: Automatically calculates how much spare change you'd save by rounding purchases to the nearest dollar.
- **Savings Growth Projection**: Projects savings growth over a year with a 5% simple interest rate.
- **Fun Personalities**: Adds an entertaining "savings personality" based on user habits.

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/change-maker.git
cd change-maker

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install Flask:

pip install flask

3. Run the App

Start the Flask app by running:

python change_maker_api.py

4. Send a Request

Use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request to the API:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/calculate

5. Example Input

Send a JSON body with a list of purchases:

{
    "purchases": [4.25, 7.30, 1.15]
}

6. Example Response

The API will return the total spare change, projected savings with interest, and a fun personality:

{
    "total_spare_change_saved": "$2.30",
    "projected_savings_with_interest": "$2.42",
    "savings_personality": "You are The Impulse Buyer Turned Saver!"
}

🔍 How It Works

Here’s a high-level view of the API’s workflow:
	1.	The user sends a list of purchases to the /calculate endpoint.
	2.	The API calculates the spare change for each purchase by rounding up to the nearest dollar.
	3.	It sums up the spare change and calculates projected growth with a 5% simple interest rate.
	4.	A random “savings personality” is selected and returned in the response.

📚 Learning Goals
